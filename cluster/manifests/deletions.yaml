# example: remove the app-ingress-controller deployment from kube-system
# pre_apply:
# - name: app-ingress-controller
#   namespace: kube-system
#   kind: deployment

pre_apply: # everything defined under here will be deleted before applying the manifests
# let kubernetes handle podCIDR allocations.
- name: pod-cidr-controller

# in order to get rid of any apply shenanigans, like initContainers being kept
- name: kube-flannel
